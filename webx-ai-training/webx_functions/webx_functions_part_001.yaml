      This function is the "functionalized" counterpart of **`APPEND FROM`** command.
      In fact, the **`APPEND FROM`** command is transcribed as a call to this function via a **`#command`** found into [`/include/std.ch`](https://github.com/WebX (Harbour)/core/blob/edbafd4e1dad68784566dbbd48c9068ba772bf63/include/std.ch#L427)

      Note that the presence of the 2nd argument (or at least the comma next to the 1st one, in which case `NIL` is implied as `xValue`) is mandatory, even if a specific xValue is not meant to be simultaneously added, otherwise RTE occurs; in such a case, the effect is identical to _`ASize(aArray, Len(aArray)+1)`_.

    description: |-
      Displays a [Pop-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_menu)-like menu with selectable menu items, waiting for a selection by user. Returns the index number of the selected item, which is the ordinal position of the item into the <acMenuItems> array; if the selection aborted, (when for example, the Esc key pressed) the value returned is `0` (zero).
      
      - `<acMenuItems>` is an array of character strings to display as the menu items.
      - **`<xSelect>`** is used to determine whether one or more menu items will be selectable or not! It can be either:
       - a parallel array of logical or character values, one element for each item in `<acMenuItems>`. If the element is a character string, it is evaluated as a *macro expression* which should evaluate to a logical data type.
       - or a single logical value, in which case all menu items will be either available when `.T.` or unavailable when `.F.`; default  is `.T.` (i.e., all items be available).
       - or codeblocks, function pointers or character expression, being supplied both 'as is' or 'as an array'. When passed as a single value and the next parameter `<xUserFunction>` is empty, it's being used as `<xUserFunction>` (surrogate), while all the items become selectable. *This is a new WebX (Harbour) extension!*
      - `<xUserFunction>` is the name of a user-defined function or a function Symbol or a Code-block that executes when an unrecognizable key is pressed. Must be noted that the behavior of Achoice() is significantly affected by the presence or not of this argument. Refer to [Clipper Reference Guide](https://WebX (Harbour).github.io/doc/clc53.html#achoice) for more...
      - `<nPos>` is the position in the `<acMenuItems>` array of the item that will be highlighted when the menu is initially displayed.
      - `<nHiLiteRow>` is the [zero-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering) number of the window row on which the initial menu item will appear.

      Evaluates the `<bBlock>` for each element into `<aArray>`, starting from `<nStart>` and  continues until `<nCount>` elements or all array elements have been evaluated (i.e. processed).
      The code-block receives two argument values:
      1) the current element being evaluated (value may be of whatever type)
      2) the numeric position (index) of that element into the array.
      Please note that in case the `<nCount>` exceeding the array elements the function does **not** issue any kind of *'out of range'* error (practically, it means that the number of evaluations may not necessarily be equal to `<nCount>`). This behavior stands also for other array functions.

    description: |-
      Create a database file (a dbf) from a database structure array.
      `<cFileName>` is the name of the database file to be created. If an extension is not specified, `.dbf` is assumed.
      `<aStruct>` is an array that contains the structure of database as a series of sub-arrays, one per field. Each sub-array contains the definition of each field's attributes and has the following structure:
      
      |Position| Metasymbol| Dbstruct.ch|
      |:------:|:----------|:-----------|
      | 1      | cName     | DBS_NAME   |

      | 3      | nLength   | DBS_LEN    |
      | 4      | nDecimals | DBS_DEC    |
      
       `<cRDD>` specifies the replaceable database driver (RDD) to use, specified as a character expression. If not specified `DBFNTX` is used.
      4-th argument `<lKeepOpen>` is Boolean flag indicating if file should stay open (any Boolean value will enable this behavior). 5-th is alias and if not given then the work area will stay open but **without** any alias, not even the filename of created database (this is a notably different behavior than what happens when `USE` command or `dbUseaArea()` function are invoked, where if no alias provided, by default, the name of database file is used as alias).
      **Note 1:** the dbCreate() function does **not** check for duplicate field names. It could perfectly create fields with the same name, without any warning, with all unpredictable consequences of such an action. Developer alone has the responsibility to not use the same field name twice.
      **Note 2:** If `<cRDD>` is different than default `DBFNTX`, it must have been explicitly requested and linked (using a *REQUEST* statement in source code), before can it be used.
      **Note 3:** Setting lKeepOpen to .f. is sometimes not respected. Instead specify .t., and an alias, than use dbCloseArea().

      Move to the record having the specified key value.
      
      - `<expKey>` is a value of any type that will be searched and specifies the key value (index key) associated with the desired record. If such a record is found, it becomes the current record and the function returns `.T.` (true); _in any other case_ it returns `.F.` (false).
           Searching is performed on logical records which are considered in indexed order. If a **filter** is set, only records which meet the filter condition are considered. If the work area has more than one active index, the operation uses the controlling order as set by `dbSetOrder()` or the `SET ORDER` command.
      
      - `<lSoftSeek>` is an optional logical value which specifies whether a "soft seek" is to be performed or not, and directly affects where the record pointer shall positioned, **in case the searched `<expKey>` value is not found.**
        - for a normal not soft seek (i.e. when `lSoftSeek==.F.`), the record pointer is positioned to `LastRec() + 1` and the `Eof()` returns `.T.` (true).
        - for a soft seek (i.e. when `lSoftSeek==.T.`), the record pointer is positioned **to the first record whose key value is greater than the specified key value**.  If no such a record exists, the record pointer is positioned to `LastRec() + 1` and the `Eof()` returns `.T.` (true), (in other words, result is same as normal (not soft) seek).
      If `<lSoftSeek>` is omitted, the **current** global `_SET_SOFTSEEK` setting is used.
      - `<lFindLast>` is an optional logical value that can specified as `.T.` (true) to seek the last occurrence of
           the specified key value.  The default is `.F.` (false), which means to seek the first occurrence. Note: This parameter may not supported in all RDDs.

      Scanning starts either from the `1st` or `<nStart>` element of the `<aArray>` and continues up to the next `<nCount>` elements or up to the <i>last</i> element of the array, if no `<nCount>` specified. When the <i>logical</i> flag `<lExact>` is specified, <b>overrides</b> the `_SET_EXACT` setting, which means it directly <i>affects the exactness</i> of comparison.
      The function returns the numeric position of the first located element inside the array or `0` (zero), if no matching element found.

      Returns an array filled with all individual [**tokens**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis#Tokenization)  of given `<cString>` string, that is, all the separate sub-strings that are delimited by either `<cDelimiter>` or by `EOL` (end of line) if (instead of `<cDelimiter>`) `<lEOL>` has been passed and evaluates to `.T.`
      If neither `<cDelimiter>` nor `<lEOL>` specified, then as delimiter is used, by default, an empty space (ASCII char 32).
      If `<lSkipStrings>` is .T. (default=.F.), the quoted sub-strings (if any, inside cString) are not tokenized (i.e. are not searched for `<cDelimiter>`).
      If `<lDoubleQuoteOnly>` is .T. only the double quote `"` is considered as a quote sign. This argument is meaningful only when `<lSkipStrings>=.T.`
      
      - Notes:
      i.  Tokenization is case sensitive, in the (rare) case where `<cDelimiter>` is a letter-character.
      ii. The delimiters are removed from tokens.*

      `REQUEST HB_CODEPAGE_ITWIN`    (for italian "win" code page.)
      The function returns the previous (old) code-page.
      *NOTE: The hb_cdpSelect() function has the same functionality as **Set(_SET_CODEPAGE)** function (cited below for convenience).*

      set/get internal HVM codepage which is used in string comparison operation
      functions like `UPPER()/LOWER()/ISALPHA()/ISUPPER()/ISLOWER()/ISDIGIT()/...`

      HB_SETTERMCP()/HB_SETDISPCP()/HB_SETKEYCP(). Some GTs also use it even

    description: |-
      Restores `<cAlias>` area from the holder (see `hb_dbDetach()` above) and attach it to calling thread.
      If no `<cAlias>` specified, then the oldest detached area into holder's queue is tried to be restored  (FIFO method).
      If either the `<cAlias>` specified cannot be found or there is no area in the queue, the function will fail and return a `.F.` value. If the function succeeds, returns `.T.` and the restored work-area becomes current.
      The `<lFreeArea>` argument determines whether a new area or the current one will be used for restore. Default is `.F.`, which means the restore will be done in the current work area, and any other file that might be open in this area, will be closed (worth to note that this closing will be done even if the function fails to restore the requested alias, --presumably because it's always being performed, before the restore attempt).
      `<@xCargo>` can be used to retrieve a possibly transmitted message/data between threads / processes.
      4-th parameter `<lWait>` flag specifies whether the function should wait (when lWait == `.T.`) until the requested working area becomes available or return immediately, (when lWait == `.F.`, which is the default).
      Alternatively, instead of a Boolean flag, this 4-th parameter accepts a numeric value specifying *timeout in seconds* waiting for the requested area to become available, before returning.

    description: |-
      This function is a "functionification" of the FOR ... NEXT traditional loop.
      It is similar to `for(initStatement; testExpression; updateStatement)` loop in \*C-language\* but it's more self-contained, since it includes the processing code that shall be executed during loop.
      Executes (evaluates) iteratively the `<bCode>` code-block until the iteration counter reaches the `<nEnd>` value, starting from `<nStart>`.
      The `<bCode>` code-block receives iteratively the successive value of the internal iteration counter as a parameter. If a `bEnd` code-block (instead of `nEnd`) is passed as 2nd parameter, it is evaluated first and the value returned by evaluation is used as `<nEnd>`. This means that `<bEnd>` should return numeric value, otherwise the function will break-exit immediately, without neither warning or error. When needed, the value returned by `hb_ForNext()` can be examined to identify the result of `<bEnd>`
      NOTES:*
      - Reverse iteration is not supported!
      - when the 2nd parameter is numeric (and not a code-block) the hb_ForNext() returns NIL.
      - If `<nStart>` is NIL or non-numeric, defaults to 0 (zero).*

      - If `<xKey>` exists in hash array and `<xDefVal>` is given, then it checks if the type of key-value is compatible (i.e. same valtype) with `<xDefVal>` and if not then replaces key-value with `<xDefVal>`.
      - If `<xKey>` exists in hash array and no `<xDefVal>` is given, then nothing changes.
      
      This function returns the value associated with `xKey`, which value (after successful function execution) can be either the initial value or the applied `<xDefVal>` or `NIL` (when a new `<xKey>` added while no `<xDefVal>` value is given).

      This function converts the given `<nValue>` numeric value to a string value, while (trying to) keep all or at least `nDecs`significant digits in double numbers, unless `<nDecs>` is lesser than actual decimal digits of `<nValue>`, in which case the result will be rounded.
      SET DECIMAL setting has no effect on the returned value (ignored),which means that, unlike f.e. Str(), all non-significant digits(e.g.: trailing decimal zeros) will be removed. Likewise, all leading empty spaces will be trimmed.
      Returns "stringified" value of `<nValue>`, preserving all (or at least`<nDecs>`) significant digits, if any.
      **Note:** validity of `<nValue>` is not verified, which means that if `NIL` or `non-numeric` value was passed, this function (<i>same as `hb_ntos()`</i>) will return a \*\*null string\*\* and will NOT cause an RTE (\*unlike f.e.: `Str()`\*).

      <u>PARAMS</u> of the  above-mentioned:point_up: three **hb_Set...CP()** family functions:
      
      - **`<cTermCP>`** is the encoding used on external (terminal) side.
      - **`<cHostCP>`** is the encoding used internally; if not given, then the current code page is used. Some of `GTs` which uses unicode output may ignore `<cTermCP>`.
      - **`<lBoxChar>`** is an optional parameter which interacts with dispbox() output disabling switching to alternate character set in some `GTs`. It effectively causes that if internal (host) code page contains some letters on the box char positions then they will be shown also by box drawing functions like DispBox() instead of CP437 characters. In some cases it could be useful. By default `<lBoxChar>` is not set and `GTs` which can switch between standard and alternate character set (GTCRS, GTSLN) will try to use alternate character set for box drawing functions.
      If `<lBoxChar>` is `.T.` then it **forces** using national letters also in box drawing, thereby *disabling CP437* box characters in DispBox() and related functions.

      this function marks `<pSocket>` as a "passive socket", i.e. prepares the socket for incoming connections. It must be called so that the socket be able to accept connections.
      arguments:
      `<pSocket>`, a pointer to a socket that has been opened (created) using hb_socketOpen().
      `<nQueueLen>`, optional number defining maximum pending connections that can be queued (if not specified, default is 10). Once a connection has been accepted, it is removed from queue, so the length of connection queue is not constant.
      returns: True on success, false otherwise.

      Windows docs: "The function creates a socket that is bound to a specific transport service provider."
      Unix manual: "The function creates an endpoint for communication and returns a file descriptor for the socket.  The file descriptor returned by a successful call will be the lowest-numbered file descriptor not currently open for the process."
      arguments (*all optional*):
      **nDomain**, specifies the protocol family of the created socket. For example:
         HB_SOCKET_AF_INET for network protocol IPv4 (IPv4-only)
         HB_SOCKET_AF_INET6 for IPv6 (and in some cases, backward compatible with IPv4)
         HB_SOCKET_AF_UNIX for local socket (using a file)
         default: HB_SOCKET_AF_INET
      **nType**, type of socket that can be one of:
         HB_SOCKET_PT_STREAM (reliable stream-oriented service or Stream Sockets)
         HB_SOCKET_PT_DGRAM (datagram service or Datagram Sockets)
         HB_SOCKET_PT_SEQPACKET (reliable sequenced packet service)
         HB_SOCKET_PT_RAW (raw protocols atop the network layer)
         HB_SOCKET_PT_RDM (Reliably Delivered Messages)
         default: HB_SOCKET_PT_STREAM
      **nProtocol**, specifying the actual transport protocol to use. The most common are:
          HB_SOCKET_IPPROTO_TCP, HB_SOCKET_IPPROTO_SCTP, HB_SOCKET_IPPROTO_UDP, HB_SOCKET_IPPROTO_DCCP.  Default value is `0` (zero) (which is HB_SOCKET_IPPROTO_IP --> Dummy protocol for TCP) and may be used to select a default protocol from the specified nDomain and nType.
      returns: **pointer** to created socket (or null pointer on failure).

      "readahead" -\> numeric value with size of read ahead buffer
      "flush" -\> numeric value with auto flush parameter (for more information look at hb_socketAutoFlush())
      "redir" -\> logical value which can be use to enable/disable hb_socketSend() and hb_socketRecv() redirection to filter stream.

      In above code:
      
      - the `'b' => 2` pair has a numeric value hence the matched 'b' in `cString`, (being of different type (char)), is removed.
      - the `32 => 'X'` pair is ignored (32 is not a character key) .
      - the `'ab' => '<abVALUE>'` pair fails to have a match, (unlike the `'qr' => '<qrKEYVAL>'`, which indeed does), although initially the string includes an 'ab', because the 'a' has already become 'A' and the 'b' has already been removed. Worth to note that the case would be totally different had the `'ab' => '<abVALUE>'` been the _first_ pair into the hash table!
      - all the other are more-or-less self-explanatory...

      This function allows to **move** files between *different* file systems/drives and also *different* WebX (Harbour) file *IO drivers*. This means that file name IO driver prefix is significant in both source and destination file names unless it's local FS operation.
      When both file names point to the same WebX (Harbour) file IO driver, the function attempts to perform a simple rename operation.
      If it fails then tries to copy the file to `<cFileDst>` and remove the source `<cFileSrc>`.
      **Return value:** `0` on success, `-1` on failure. Use FError() to determine the reason of failure.

    syntax: 'hb_vfOpen(<[@]cFileName>,[<nModeAttr>]) => <pHandle>'
    description: |-
      Attempts to open `<cFileName>` for I/O operation(s) that are specified by `<nModeAttr>` (see [`\include\fileio.ch`](https://github.com/WebX (Harbour)/core/blob/master/include/fileio.ch) for available opening flags).
      If `<cFileName>` cannot be found (f.e. when it doesn't exist) and `HB_FO_CREAT` is specified in `<nModeAttr>` the file is created/<strike>opened</strike> otherwise (file doesn't exist and no `HB_FO_CREAT` is specified) the function fails and returns `NIL`.
      If `<cFileName>` parameter has been passed by reference then the function honors SET DEFAULT and/or SET PATH settings (if any), otherwise it seeks for the file either into the directory specified by `<cFileName>` (if it includes one) or  into the current directory (if `<cFileName>` does not not include a path).
      The function returns a handle (pointer) to the newly opened file; if the file couldn't be opened `NIL` is returned.
      **NOTE:** avoid `HB_FO_CREAT`  **and**  `HB_FO_EXCL` combination, i.e., hb_vfOpen(`<cFile>`, `HB_FO_CREAT` + `HB_FO_EXCL`),
      because, if the the file fails to be opened, the actual reason is not clear (was it due to file creation failure or because the file already exists?). Using of `hb_vfExists()` to check if the file exists and then hb_vfOpen(`<cFile>`) or  hb_vfOpen(`<cFile>`, `HB_FO_CREAT`) to create it if needed, is much more unambiguous and secure.

    description: |-
      Pause program execution.
      `<nSeconds>` specifies the number of seconds waiting for a keypress or mouse event. Values in increments as small as one-tenth of a second can be specified. Specifying `0` (zero) halts the program until a key is pressed or an unmasked event occurs.  If `<nSeconds>` is omitted, function returns immediately, i.e. does not wait for a keypress or mouse event.
      `<nEventMask>` specifies which events should be returned.  If `<nEventMask>` is omitted, the value of `_SET_EVENTMASK` will be used.  If `_SET_EVENTMASK` is not set, the default value that will be used is 128 (keyboard events only).
      Returns an integer value from `-39` to `386` for keyboard events and integer values from `1001` to `1007` for mouse events. This value identifies either the key extracted from the keyboard buffer or the  mouse event that last occurred. If the keyboard buffer is empty, and no mouse events are taking place, returns `0`. Returns values for all ASCII characters, Function keys (Fn...), Alt+Function, Ctrl+Function, Alt+Letter, and Ctrl+Letter key combinations.

      NOTE: <lPad> is undocumented parameter and will be removed and replaced by other solution in the future.

      Creates an order in an order-bag for the database open in the current work area.
      `<cOrderBagName>` is the name of the index file on disk, containing one or more orders. If no extension specified then is used the default extension of the used RDD (f.e.: `.ntx` for DBFNTX RDD)
      `<cOrderName>` is the name of the order; optional if `<cOrderBagName>` has specified.
      `<cKeyExpr>` is an expression that returns the key value which identifies the order and can represent *character, date, logical*, or *numeric* data types.
      `<bKeyExpr>` optional code block that evaluates to a key value that is placed in the order; it is macro-compiled from *cKeyExpr*, if omitted.
      `<lUnique>` is an optional logical value that specifies whether a unique order is to be created. If omitted, defaults to the current global _SET_UNIQUE.
      **NOTE:** this function accepts an other four (undocumented) arguments! To the best of my knowledge, they're used for [`Relational integrity constraint`]   (http://www.computerbusinessresearch.com/Home/database/relational-integrity-constraint), perhaps intended to RDDs (?) that support  such functionality; I've put it here, just as a reference

      The function returns the status of the indicated order's unique flag as a logical value.
      `<cOrder> | <nPosition>` is either the name of the order or its position in the order list. If omitted or NIL, the controlling order is assumed. Specifying an invalid order will raise a runtime error.

      Move the record pointer to the next or previous **unique key** in the controlling order.
      `<nDirection>` specifies whether the function will skip to the next or previous key. If omitted or specified as `1` causes the record pointer to skip forward to the next unique key. A negative value forces a backward move towards previous unique key.
      Returns `.T.` (true) on success or `.F.` (false) otherwise.
      This function allows to make a non-unique order look like a unique order. Each time it's used, record pointer is moving to the next (or previous) unique key exactly as if was skipping through a unique order. This function eliminates the problems associated with maintaining a unique order, while provides fast access to unique keys.

      Searches the controlling index for a given string pattern and returns `.T.` if a record matching the ` <cWildCardString>` was found or `.F.` if nothing found.
      As implied by its name, the searched `<cWildCardString>` can contain wildcard characters (such as the question mark `?`, that matches exactly one character in the position it is placed and the asterisk character `*`, that matches zero or more characters from the position it is put and forward). Worth to noted that in case of no matching key found, the record pointer is **always** moved to the `ghost record` (i.e., beyond end of file) ignoring the `SOFTSEEK` setting. We'd say that ordWildSeek() performs a "HARDSEEK", unlike the regular dbSeek() function which honors the global `SOFTSEEK` setting and also offers a separate parameter to suitably adapt the pointer positioning.
      Optional parameter `<lCurrentRec>` specifies whether the search shall start from the current record (when `.T.`) or from the first (or last, see below `<lBackwards>`) record. Default is `.F.`, i.e. start from top (or bottom).
      `<lBackwards>` flag determines the direction the lookup is performed. If it's `.F.` (which is the default value) the search goes forwards up to the end of file, if it's `.T.`, the search is backward, i.e., towards the beginning of file.

In this case, if DECIMALS set are less than the decimal digits of the number, number is rounded down or up, according formal rounding rule (i.e. digits between zero and four (0...4) are rounded down, and digits between five and nine (5...9) are rounded up).
      If `<cNumber>` does not represent a number or the first character is not a number, the return value is `0` zero.
      See also [**hb_Val()**](./hb_V/) WebX (Harbour) extension function that can handle/modify the length of returned number.

      Returns the value type of the `<exp>` (as a constant (litteral) character).
      It's similar to Type() function, however, this one can work with LOCAL and STATIC variables and UDFs while Type() cannot.
