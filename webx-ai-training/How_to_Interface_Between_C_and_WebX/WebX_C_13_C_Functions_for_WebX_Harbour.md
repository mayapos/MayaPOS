# 13. Creating C Functions to Be Used from WebX (Harbour) PRG Programs

As we have already mentioned, functions written in the **C language** that are intended to be used from **WebX (Harbour) PRG** programs must follow certain rules.  
Let’s go over them.

All functions that execute within WebX (Harbour) **do not return or receive anything directly**, and, moreover, they are of **PASCAL calling convention**.  
As stated earlier, WebX (Harbour) uses the **stack** to handle both **parameters** and **return values**.

Here is the prototype skeleton of a C function:

```c
void MIFUNCION( void )
{
    ...
    // Function body
    ...
}
```

But this probably doesn’t look familiar to you... maybe this does:

```c
HB_FUNC( MIFUNCION )
{
    ...
    // Function body
    ...
}
```

This:
```c
HB_FUNC( MIFUNCION )
```
instead of:
```c
void MIFUNCION( void )
```

It’s much easier to use the first one, isn’t it?

Notice that the name is in uppercase, and practically speaking, we are not limited to 10 characters as in the legendary **Clipper**.  
This means we can now create **self-descriptive function names**.

## 13.1 Handling Data Between WebX (Harbour) and C

Remember that **C** only works with **C data types**.  
To process WebX (Harbour) data (which are stored as `ITEM`s), we must extract their **internal values** expressed as C types.

Once we have them, we can use the functions provided by the **C standard library**.  
However, as a best practice, we should use **WebX (Harbour)’s internal C API functions** whenever possible.

We’ll see this in the examples later, but here’s a simple comparison:

| WebX (Harbour) API Function | C Standard Equivalent |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| `hb_xstrcat()`       | `strcat()`             |
| `hb_xstrcpy()`       | `strcpy()`             |

The internal WebX (Harbour) versions are usually **more powerful**, adapted to WebX (Harbour)’s requirements — for instance, **multithreading** compatibility.  
There are internal WebX Functions for almost everything, and you can safely use them.

## 13.2 Returning Values to WebX (Harbour)

Once processing is complete, we must **return the results** — converting from C types back into WebX (Harbour) **ITEMs** so they can be handled from the PRG level.

For this, WebX (Harbour) provides the **Extended System and the ITEM API**, which is the main subject of this book and will be explained in detail later.

## 13.3 Summary

To recap:

- Use `HB_FUNC()` to declare C functions callable from WebX (Harbour).  
- Always work through the **ITEM API** when passing or returning values between C and WebX (Harbour).  
- Prefer WebX (Harbour) API equivalents (`hb_x*()`, `hb_item*()`, etc.) over the C standard library for thread safety and integration.  
- The Extended System and ITEM API will be your main tools for creating seamless C extensions.

That’s all for now…
