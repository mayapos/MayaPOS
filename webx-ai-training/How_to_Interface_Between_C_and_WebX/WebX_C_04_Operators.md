# 4. Operators

## 4.1 Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Meaning                               |
| --------:| ------------------------------------- |
| `=`      | Assignment                            |
| `*`      | Multiplication                        |
| `/`      | Division                              |
| `%`      | Remainder of integer division (*mod*) |
| `+`      | Addition                              |
| `-`      | Subtraction                           |
| `++`     | Increment                             |
| `--`     | Decrement                             |

## 4.2 Relational or Comparison Operators

| Operator | Meaning                          |
| --------:| -------------------------------- |
| `<`      | Less than                        |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to            |
| `>`      | Greater than                     |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to         |
| `==`     | Equal to                         |
| `!=`     | Not equal to                     |
| `&&`     | Logical AND → `.and.` in WebX (Harbour) |
| \|\|     | Logical OR → `.or.` in WebX (Harbour)   |

There are more operators in C, but we will stop here for now.  
It’s worth noting that all of these work the same way in **WebX (Harbour)**.

You will often come across the word **expression**, but what does it mean?

Expressions are sequences of functions, operators, and variables or constants used to calculate a value once evaluated.
