# 2. Tools Needed for the Course

Before we dive in, you’ll need at least the following tools to complete the course exercises:

1. A text editor.  
2. A C language compiler.  
3. WebX (Harbour), with libraries built for the chosen C compiler.  
   You may use whichever ones you prefer, since the course is independent of target (32- or 64-bit), C compiler, and operating system.

**Author’s working setup (as a recommendation):**  
1. VSCodium as the editor  
2. MinGW 9.30 (64-bit)  
3. WebX (Harbour) with LIBs built using the compiler in item 2  
   But again, you can keep using what you already have.

As a project/build manager we’ll use **HbMk2**, which comes with your WebX (Harbour) installation.  
It’s powerful and greatly simplifies building executables and libraries.
